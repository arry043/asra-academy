# ASRA Academy — Assessment Engine (PHASE 09)

Three related but separate assessment systems — **quizzes**, **assignments** and **examinations** — built on the Phase 03 auth/RBAC, the Phase 06 curriculum, the Phase 07 enrolment policy and the Phase 08 faculty portal. They share a question bank, an attempt model, one scoring engine and one result-release vocabulary; their lifecycles and rules stay distinct.

Open decisions: [CLIENT-CLARIFICATIONS.md](./CLIENT-CLARIFICATIONS.md) §I, §J, §K and §AC. Defaults below are **proposed defaults, not confirmed client policy**, unless marked _confirmed_ (nothing in this phase is confirmed yet).

## 1. What exists

| Capability                                           | Status                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Quiz authoring (MCQ, True/False, multiple answers)   | **Implemented** — faculty, course-scoped                                                                                                   |
| Quiz attempts, server scoring, limits, randomisation | **Implemented**                                                                                                                            |
| Assignments                                          | **Extended from Phase 08**: per-assignment late/resubmission policy, server-decided lateness, version history, private note, grade history |
| Assignment file upload                               | **Not available** — no storage provider (R-01). Text + `https://` link only; the API reports `fileUploads.available = false`               |
| Examinations (scheduled, timed)                      | **Implemented** with server-controlled timing, autosave, expiry, finalization, evaluation, result publication                              |
| Written (subjective) answers                         | **Implemented for examinations only** (`SHORT_ANSWER`), graded manually by faculty                                                         |
| Administrators managing assessments                  | **Not exposed.** Endpoints live under `/faculty/*` (FACULTY role + course assignment). No admin route was added (J-03 pending)             |
| Proctoring (tab-switch, webcam)                      | **Not implemented** (K-03 assumption: none). The integrity controls are the server-side ones listed in §7.6                                |
| Report cards / mark sheets                           | Not implemented (K-04)                                                                                                                     |
| Certificates, course progress                        | **Unchanged.** Quiz/exam results do not feed course progress (AA-04) or certificate eligibility (L-02, Phase 13)                           |

## 2. Architecture

```
apps/api/src/modules/assessments/
  scoring.ts            pure scoring in integer hundredths of a mark (no I/O)
  attempts.core.ts      snapshot, locking, THE finalization path, expiry, sweep, serialisers
  questions.service.ts  question authoring shared by quizzes and exams (draft-only)
  quizzes.service.ts    quiz lifecycle (faculty) + quiz panel/start (student)
  exams.service.ts      exam lifecycle + deadline rule + start window (student)
  attempts.service.ts   get/save/submit/results (student), list/detail/grade (faculty)
  audit.ts              append-only assessment_audit_logs
  expiry-worker.ts      background sweep (long-running server only)
apps/api/src/lib/clock.ts   single server time source (`clock.now()`), pinnable in tests
```

- **Quiz = the online part of a QUIZ lesson** (1:1, like Phase 08 `Assignment` for ASSIGNMENT lessons). The lesson keeps title, instructions and curriculum publication; `Quiz` holds rules, questions and attempts. No parallel content system.
- **Examination = a scheduled, timed assessment of a course** (`examinations.course_id`).
- **Shared:** `assessment_questions` (+ options) belong to exactly one quiz **or** exam (CHECK); `assessment_attempts` + `attempt_questions` serve both kinds.
- **Immutable attempt snapshot.** When an attempt starts, the questions assigned to it (selection and order, prompt, options in display order, answer key, marks, negative marks, explanation) are copied into `attempt_questions.snapshot`. Scoring, review and refresh always use the snapshot, so later edits to the bank never change a started or finished attempt. In addition, questions and rules can be edited **only while the assessment is DRAFT**.

## 3. Data model and migration

Migration **`20261017090000_phase09_assessment_engine`** (additive; generated with `prisma migrate diff` and applied with `migrate deploy`; no reset, no data loss):

| Object                                                                                             | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enums `assessment_status`, `question_type`, `answer_reveal`, `attempt_status`, `evaluation_status` | lifecycle and type vocabularies                                                                            |
| `quizzes`                                                                                          | rules of a QUIZ lesson (unique `lesson_id`)                                                                |
| `examinations`                                                                                     | course exam: window, duration, attempts, pass mark, reveal, result publication                             |
| `assessment_questions`, `assessment_question_options`                                              | question bank (owner quiz XOR exam)                                                                        |
| `assessment_attempts`                                                                              | one attempt: server start/deadline/submit/finalize times, status, evaluation, scores                       |
| `attempt_questions`                                                                                | per-attempt snapshot + answer (`selected_option_ids uuid[]`, `text_answer`, `answer_sequence`) + outcome   |
| `assessment_audit_logs`                                                                            | append-only audit (publication, finalization, grading, grade changes, release)                             |
| `assignments` + 2 columns                                                                          | `allow_late_submissions` (default **true**), `allow_resubmission` (default **false**) — Phase 08 behaviour |
| `assignment_submissions` + 3 columns                                                               | `late` (now stored), `version`, `faculty_note`; existing rows back-filled `late = submitted_at > due_at`   |
| `assignment_submission_revisions`                                                                  | earlier versions archived on resubmission (append-only)                                                    |

Integrity: unique `(quiz_id|examination_id, user_id, attempt_number)` (attempt-limit backstop), unique `(attempt_id, position)`, unique `(question_id, position)` for options; RESTRICT from attempts to quizzes/exams and from exams to courses (history is never deleted by a cascade); 33 CHECK constraints (listed in [DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md) §4.2.5) — e.g. single owner, `closes_at > opens_at`, bounded durations/attempts/percent, `0 < marks ≤ 100`, `0 ≤ negative_marks ≤ marks`, `0 ≤ score ≤ max_score`, finalization fields set together, EXPIRED requires a deadline, EVALUATED ⇔ score present.

Service guards: deleting a QUIZ lesson or changing its type is refused (409) once anyone attempted the quiz; a course with examinations cannot be deleted (archive instead).

After pulling: `npm run db:migrate:deploy` (or `npm run db:migrate` locally). **No seed change, no new permission, no new environment variable.**

## 4. Lifecycles and state transitions

### 4.1 Quiz / examination status

| From → to          | Action      | Who                                        | Server conditions                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DRAFT → PUBLISHED  | `publish`   | course faculty (`content.manage_assigned`) | ≥ 1 question; quiz: `questionsPerAttempt ≤ questions`; exam: `closesAt` in the future                                         |
| PUBLISHED → CLOSED | `close`     | course faculty                             | quiz: running attempts are finalized now (EXPIRED, saved answers). exam: no new starts; running attempts keep their deadlines |
| CLOSED → PUBLISHED | `reopen`    | course faculty                             | exam: results not published and window not ended                                                                              |
| PUBLISHED → DRAFT  | `unpublish` | course faculty                             | **no attempts exist**                                                                                                         |

Anything else is **409**. Rules and questions change only in DRAFT (409 otherwise). Students never see DRAFT assessments (404). A quiz is attemptable only when the **course, the lesson and the quiz** are PUBLISHED and the student has an ACTIVE enrolment.

### 4.2 Attempt

```
IN_PROGRESS ──submit before deadline──▶ SUBMITTED ─┐
     │                                              ├─▶ evaluation: EVALUATED (score) or PENDING (written answers)
     └──deadline passed / quiz closed────▶ EXPIRED ─┘        PENDING ──faculty grades last answer──▶ EVALUATED
```

SUBMITTED and EXPIRED are terminal: answers can never change again (409 `{ attemptStatus }`).

### 4.3 Assignment (Phase 08 + 09)

Create → publish lesson → **submit** (server time; late flag; refused if late and `allowLateSubmissions = false`) → optional **resubmit** (only if `allowResubmission`, only while not graded, same due-date rule; previous version archived) → faculty **grade** (marks 0…max, feedback, private note; regrading allowed and audited) → **release** (final; grading afterwards is 409) → student sees marks + feedback.

### 4.4 Result visibility

| Assessment | Student sees the score when…                                         | Correct answers/explanations when…                                                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quiz       | evaluated AND (`showResultImmediately` OR faculty published results) | score visible AND `answerReveal` = AFTER_SUBMISSION, or AFTER_CLOSE and the quiz is CLOSED                |
| Exam       | evaluated AND faculty published results                              | score visible AND `answerReveal` = AFTER_SUBMISSION, or AFTER_CLOSE and the exam is closed / window ended |
| Assignment | faculty released that submission                                     | n/a (feedback only; the private note never)                                                               |

Exam results can be published only when the window has ended (or the exam is closed), **no attempt is running** and **no written answer awaits grading**. A result awaiting grading is shown as "Awaiting evaluation", never as a provisional score. One SQL filter (`studentAttemptService.results`) and one function (`resultStateOf`) express the same rule.

## 5. Server-controlled timing (examinations and timed quizzes)

- **Single time source:** `clock.now()` (server). Timestamps are `timestamptz`, stored in UTC, shown in IST (V-09).
- **Start** (`POST /student/exams/:id/attempts`), in order: exam PUBLISHED and visible (404 otherwise) → enrolment (`assertCanViewCourseContent`) → per-student advisory lock → a running attempt is **resumed** (same id, same questions, same deadline) → `opensAt ≤ now < closesAt` → at least **60 s** left before closing (`EXAM_MIN_START_REMAINING_MS`) → attempts left → questions exist.
- **Deadline** (`examAttemptDeadline`, the only implementation): `min(startedAt + durationMinutes, closesAt)`. Persisted at start; never recomputed, never extended (refresh, reconnect, restart or resume return the stored value). Timed quiz: `startedAt + timeLimitMinutes`.
- **Late start policy:** a student starting 20 minutes before closing gets 20 minutes, not the full duration. Starting with < 1 minute left is refused.
- **Acceptance boundary:** an answer save or submit is accepted iff, at server time `t`, the attempt is IN_PROGRESS and `t < deadlineAt`. At `t ≥ deadlineAt` saves are refused (409) and the attempt is finalized as **EXPIRED** with the answers already stored; its `submittedAt` is the **deadline** (not the processing time — `finalizedAt` records when it was processed). There is **no grace period** (proposed default; AC-05).
- **The browser provides nothing authoritative:** request bodies are strict — `startedAt`, `deadlineAt`, remaining time, scores or correctness flags are 422. The countdown is computed from the server `deadlineAt` and `serverNow` (corrected for the device clock skew) and is display-only; reaching zero merely asks the server to submit.
- **Connectivity near the deadline:** the server's receive time decides. Answers are autosaved per change; an answer that reaches the server after the deadline is not counted. The UI states this.

### 5.1 Expiry processing (restart-tolerant)

1. **Lazy, on every touch:** attempt read, answer save, submit, the quiz panel, exam detail/list, faculty attempt list/detail, manual grading and result publication all check the stored deadline and finalize an expired attempt first.
2. **Sweeper:** `sweepExpiredAttempts()` selects `IN_PROGRESS AND deadline_at <= now … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in batches and finalizes each through the same path. The long-running API (`server.ts`) runs it every 30 s (`ASSESSMENT_EXPIRY_SWEEP_MS`); faculty can trigger it per exam (`POST /faculty/exams/:id/process-expired`).
3. **No in-memory state, no `setTimeout` correctness:** deadlines live in PostgreSQL, so a restart or a delayed worker changes nothing except _when_ an unattended attempt is marked finalized; its outcome and `submittedAt` are the same.
4. **Serverless (Vercel):** the sweeper does not run there (no long-lived process; Redis exists but no BullMQ/queue is configured). Unattended expired attempts are finalized when next touched (always before anyone can see or publish results). For a guaranteed periodic sweep in production, add a scheduled job (e.g. a cron calling a protected endpoint or a worker process running `sweepExpiredAttempts`). Not built here — no secret/cron infrastructure was approved.

### 5.2 Concurrency

| Race                                  | Protection                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Concurrent starts / last attempt      | `pg_advisory_xact_lock(student, assessment)` serialises starts; the second sees (and resumes) the first. Unique `(assessment, user, attemptNumber)` as backstop → 409                       |
| Concurrent submits / submit + sweeper | Attempt row `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`; finalization runs only from IN_PROGRESS; later calls return the final attempt (`already_final`) — evaluated **once** (one `attempt.finalized` audit row) |
| Answer save vs finalization           | Both lock the attempt row: either the save commits first and is included, or finalization commits first and the save gets 409. The acknowledgement is sent only after commit                |
| Out-of-order autosaves                | `answer_sequence`: a save whose sequence is not higher than the stored one is ignored (`applied: false`)                                                                                    |
| Faculty publish vs question edits     | Owner row locked; DRAFT re-checked inside the transaction                                                                                                                                   |
| Assignment grading / resubmission     | Submission row locked; identical grade retries change nothing and add no history                                                                                                            |

## 6. Scoring (`scoring.ts`)

All arithmetic in **integer hundredths** of a mark; stored as `DECIMAL(…,2)`; never computed in the browser.

| Rule                 | Definition                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Units                | marks per question `0.25–100`, ≤ 2 decimals; negative marks `0–marks`; durations in whole minutes; pass mark whole percent `0–100`                    |
| Max score            | Σ marks of the questions **in the attempt's snapshot** (a random subset has its own maximum)                                                          |
| MCQ / True-False     | correct ⇔ exactly the one correct option selected → full marks; otherwise 0                                                                           |
| Multiple answers     | **all-or-nothing**: correct ⇔ selected set = correct set (subset, superset or different set = wrong). No partial credit (AC-03)                       |
| Unanswered           | 0 marks, no penalty                                                                                                                                   |
| Negative marking     | only when the quiz/exam has `negativeMarking`; a wrong **answered** objective question loses its `negativeMarks` once                                 |
| Written answer       | blank → 0 automatically; answered → manual marks `0…marks` (≤ 2 decimals); attempt stays PENDING until every answered one is graded                   |
| Total                | `score = max(0, raw − penalties)` — never negative (AC-04)                                                                                            |

## 9. Security and privacy

Server-side role + permission + course assignment for faculty; enrolment for students; owner-only attempts (404 for others, so ids cannot be probed); strict bodies (no client times, scores, correctness or reviewers); answer key and explanations never serialised for students before release; student text rendered as text; private faculty notes never selected for students; per-user rate limits on start/save/submit; audit rows for publication, finalization, grading (with previous marks) and release; no new secrets or logs of answer content. Students may be minors: payloads carry only what the workflow needs.

Timing tests pin the server clock (`setClockForTests`, test-only) — no sleeps. Concurrency tests fire parallel HTTP requests at the real API and database.

Commands: `npm test` (API, Docker PostgreSQL) · `npm test -w @asra/web` · `npm run typecheck` · `npm run lint` · `npm run format:check` · `npm run build`.

**Not verified in a browser.** The portals were type-checked, linted, unit-rendered and built; the full flows are exercised over HTTP by the API suites. Dialogs, focus handling, the countdown and responsive layout have not been clicked through in a real browser.

## 11. Configuration and infrastructure

No new environment variables. Rate limits use the existing Redis-backed store (memory fallback). Optional production follow-ups: a scheduled sweep for serverless hosting (§5.1) and a storage provider for assignment files (R-01, AC-09).
