### Why the two additional models

`UserRole` and `RolePermission` are explicit join tables rather than Prisma implicit many-to-many relations. This gives:

- snake_case table and column names, consistent with every other table;
- an assignment timestamp (`assigned_at`, `granted_at`), which audit logging (FR-AUD-001) will need;
- `RESTRICT` on role deletion while users still hold that role.

No other models were added beyond the Phase 02 list.

## 2. Key design decisions

### 2.1 Users and roles: many-to-many

The requirements do not say whether a user can hold more than one role. Admin sub-roles are pending (S-01), and a faculty member who is also an admin is plausible. The schema therefore uses the **least restrictive** model: a user can hold several roles through `user_roles`.

A one-role-per-user policy, if the client confirms it, can be enforced in the Phase 03 service layer without a schema change. This is recorded as **CLIENT-CLARIFICATIONS S-04**.

Roles are **rows, not a PostgreSQL enum**. New roles (e.g. Parent/Guardian, Accounts) need no migration. `Role.isSystem` marks seeded roles that administrators must not delete.

### 2.2 Profiles are separate from User

`User` holds identity and authentication data only. Student and faculty data live in `StudentProfile` and `FacultyProfile` (each `user_id UNIQUE`, so at most one of each per user). A profile is deleted with its user (`CASCADE`).

Registration fields, date of birth, guardian details and parental consent are **pending** (D-01, E-01). They are deliberately absent and will be added by a later migration once confirmed.

### 2.3 Academic structure

- `AcademicLevel 1──< Class` and `AcademicLevel 1──< Stream`. Class and stream names are unique within a level; slugs are globally unique.
- `Subject` is **independent** of class and stream. Where a subject is taught is expressed by a **Course** (`class_id`, `stream_id`, `subject_id`, all optional). This follows SRS §1.3: a course is "a subject for a class, or a special course". No class–subject mapping table is introduced until the client confirms the subject list per class and stream (A-01, A-02).
- `AcademicLevel.board` is a free-text curriculum label (e.g. "CBSE"). Supporting more boards (A-03) does not need a redesign. `Class.gradeNumber` is deliberately **not unique**, so a second board can reuse the same grades.
- Faculty subject allocation (FR-FAC-002) is derived from course assignments. If the client needs allocation independent of courses, a `faculty_subjects` table can be added in Phase 06.
- **No academic catalogue is seeded.** Classes, streams, subjects and categories are created by admins (Phase 06).

### 2.4 Courses

- `status` (`DRAFT` | `PUBLISHED` | `ARCHIVED`). `published_at` is required once a course is published (CHECK).
- `visibility` (`PUBLIC` | `UNLISTED` | `PRIVATE`, Phase 06) is independent of `status`; see [COURSE-MANAGEMENT.md §3](./COURSE-MANAGEMENT.md#3-publication-and-visibility).
- `category_id`, `class_id`, `stream_id` and `subject_id` are all optional. Special courses have no class, and school courses do not require a category.
- **Phase 06 fields:** `thumbnail_url` (HTTPS, exclusive with `thumbnail_key`), `duration_minutes` (estimated learning time, minutes), `price_minor` + `currency` (minor units, ISO 4217; `0` = free), `discount_type` + `discount_value` (percentage 1–100 or fixed amount ≤ price). Price data is administration-only; no checkout price is derived (PHASE 10).
- **Not modelled yet:** language, level, batches and validity (B-02…B-04, A-06).
- `course_instructors` links to `faculty_profiles`, not `users`, so only faculty can be instructors. "Exactly one primary instructor when any are assigned" is a **service-layer rule**, implemented in Phase 06 (`courseInstructorsSchema`). Prisma 7.10 cannot declare the partial unique index this would need without the index being reported as drift.

### 2.5 Curriculum and content

```
Course ──< Module ──< Chapter ──< Lesson ──< Resource
```

- Each level has a 0-based `position`, unique within its parent (`@@unique([parentId, position])`) and non-negative (CHECK).
- To **reorder** siblings, do it inside one transaction. The unique index is not deferrable, so first move the affected rows to temporary positions (e.g. negative values are rejected, so use `position + 10000`), then write their final positions.
- `Lesson`: `content_type` (`VIDEO` | `DOCUMENT` | `TEXT` | `LINK`, plus `PDF` | `QUIZ` | `ASSIGNMENT` from Phase 06 — quiz/assignment are placeholders until PHASE 09), optional `body`, `status`, `duration_seconds`, `is_preview` (H-04 assumption) and `published_at` (required when published).
- `Resource` never stores binary data. It points to **exactly one** location:
  - a stored object: `storage_provider` + `storage_key` (provider-neutral, e.g. `s3`, `r2` or `vimeo` with the object key); or
  - an external URL: `external_url`.

  The CHECK `resources_location_exclusive` enforces this, and `EXTERNAL_LINK` resources must use a URL. The Zod schema `resourceInputSchema` in `@asra/validation` mirrors the same rule for API input. Since Phase 06 external URLs must be `https://` on a public domain, and the API refuses stored-object locations while no storage provider is configured (`apps/api/src/config/storage.ts`). Upload and signed URLs come in a later phase (R-01, G-01).

## 3. Conventions

| Topic        | Convention                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Naming       | Models `PascalCase` singular → tables `snake_case` plural (`@@map`). Fields `camelCase` → columns `snake_case` (`@map`). Enums `snake_case` types.                                |
| Primary keys | `UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` (built into PostgreSQL ≥ 13, available on Neon). IDs are generated by the database, so raw SQL and Prisma agree. Join tables use composite keys. |
| Timestamps   | `created_at` / `updated_at` as `timestamptz(3)`. Prisma writes UTC; `updated_at` is maintained by Prisma (`@updatedAt`).                                                          |
| Strings      | Bounded `varchar(n)` for identifiers, names and keys; `text` for long-form descriptions and bodies.                                                                               |
| Emails       | Stored trimmed and lower-case (CHECK), so the plain unique index is case-insensitive. Normalise with `emailSchema` from `@asra/validation`.                                       |
| Slugs        | `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$` (CHECK) and unique per table. Validate with `slugSchema`.                                                                                              |
| Archival     | Catalogue rows (levels, classes, streams, subjects, categories) are retired with `is_active = false`. There is no global soft-delete.                                             |
| Deletion     | `RESTRICT` from catalogue rows and from roles and faculty in use. `CASCADE` down the curriculum tree and from a user to its profiles and role links.                              |
| Updates      | All foreign keys use `ON UPDATE CASCADE` (UUID keys are never expected to change).                                                                                                |

## 4. Constraints

### 4.1 Unique

| `student_profiles`                                       | `user_id`, `student_code`                        |
| `faculty_profiles`                                       | `user_id`, `employee_code`                       |

| `modules` / `chapters` / `lessons` / `resources`         | `(parent_id, position)`                          |

Nullable unique columns (`student_code`, `employee_code`, `subjects.code`) allow any number of `NULL`s.

### 4.2 CHECK constraints (hand-written in the migration SQL)

Prisma cannot declare CHECK constraints. They are appended to `20261013042559_init_database_core/migration.sql`. Prisma Migrate does not diff CHECK constraints, so later migrations keep them; verify with `npm run db:migrate`, which reports "Already in sync".

| Constraint                                                                | Rule                                         |

| `courses_published_at_required`, `lessons_published_at_required`          | `PUBLISHED` ⇒ `published_at IS NOT NULL`     |
| `resources_location_exclusive`                                            | (provider + key) XOR external URL            |

### 4.2.1 Phase 03 CHECK constraints (`20261013045953_auth_sessions_and_tokens`)

| `auth_sessions_revocation_consistent`                                                                              | `revoked_at` and `revoked_reason` are both set or both null              |

Unique: `auth_sessions.token_hash`, `auth_sessions.previous_token_hash`, `one_time_tokens.token_hash`. Indexes: `(user_id, revoked_at)`, `(user_id, purpose)`, `expires_at` (future cleanup job). Both tables `CASCADE` from `users`. Design rationale: [AUTHENTICATION.md](./AUTHENTICATION.md).

### 4.2.2 Phase 06 CHECK constraints (`20261015071102_phase06_course_management`)

The same rules are validated first by the Zod schemas in `@asra/validation` (`courses.ts`) so clients get field-level errors; the CHECKs are the backstop. New index: `courses(status, visibility)` for the public catalogue.

### 4.2.3 Phase 07 constraints (`20261016083843_phase07_student_lms`)

| `lesson_progress_video_watched_non_negative`  | `video_watched_seconds >= 0`                        |

Unique: `enrollments(user_id, course_id)` (one enrolment per student and course; re-enrolment reactivates the row) and `lesson_progress(user_id, lesson_id)` (one current progress row per student and lesson). Indexes: `enrollments(user_id, status, last_activity_at)` (dashboard/continue learning), `enrollments(course_id, status)` (admin lists), `lesson_progress(user_id, last_viewed_at)` (history), plus the foreign keys. Referential actions: student deleted → their enrolments and progress `CASCADE`; course with enrolments → `RESTRICT` (archive instead); lesson deleted → its progress `CASCADE`, `enrollments.last_lesson_id` `SET NULL`; administrator deleted → `enrolled_by_id` `SET NULL`. Rules and rationale: [STUDENT-LMS.md](./STUDENT-LMS.md).

### 4.2.4 Phase 08 constraints (`20261016102329_phase08_faculty_portal`)

Indexes: `assignment_submissions(assignment_id, status)` (review queue/counts), `(user_id, result_released_at)` (student results), `live_class_sessions(course_id, starts_at)` and `(host_faculty_profile_id, starts_at)` (schedules), plus the foreign keys. Referential actions: lesson deleted → its `assignments` row `CASCADE`, but `assignment_submissions → assignments` is `RESTRICT`, so a lesson with submitted work cannot be deleted (the service answers 409 first); student deleted → their submissions `CASCADE`; reviewer/creator deleted → `SET NULL`; course deleted → its live classes `CASCADE` (courses are deletable only while empty drafts). Rules: [FACULTY-PORTAL.md](./FACULTY-PORTAL.md).

Foreign keys: attempts → quizzes/examinations and examinations → courses are RESTRICT (history is never cascaded away); questions/options/attempt questions CASCADE from their owner; `attempt_questions.question_id` is SET NULL (the snapshot stays authoritative); audit rows have no FK to their subject.

### 4.2.6 Phase 10 constraints (`20261019090000_phase10_enrolment_payment`)

Foreign keys: orders, payments and refunds are RESTRICT towards users, courses and each other, so financial history can never be cascaded away (a student or course with orders cannot be hard-deleted; deactivate/archive instead). `enrollments.order_id` is RESTRICT. Audit rows have no FK to their subject. `EnrollmentSource` gained `PAYMENT` (the migration only adds the value; `PAYMENT ⇒ order_id` is enforced by the payment service).

Foreign keys:

- `user_id` references `users(id)` ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE.
- `course_id` references `courses(id)` ON DELETE RESTRICT ON UPDATE CASCADE.
- `issued_by_id` references `users(id)` ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE.
  Historical completion integrity: a student, course, or enrollment with an issued certificate cannot be hard-deleted.

### 4.3 Indexes

Besides the unique indexes above, there are B-tree indexes on:

- every foreign key not already covered by a unique or composite index (`user_roles.role_id`, `role_permissions.permission_id`, `student_profiles.class_id`/`stream_id`, `course_instructors.faculty_profile_id`, `courses.category_id`/`stream_id`/`subject_id`, and `(class_id, subject_id)`);
- the main listing filters: `users.status`, `courses(status, published_at)`, `lessons.status`, `faculty_profiles.is_public`, `classes.grade_number`, and `(is_active, sort_order)` on catalogue tables;
- Phase 12 analytics time series: `users.created_at` (student registrations) and `enrollments.enrolled_at` (new enrolments); `admin_audit_logs` on `created_at`, `(action, created_at)`, `(entity_type, entity_id, created_at)` and `actor_id` for the audit viewer. Payment analytics reuse the Phase 10 `(status, mode, captured_at)` index;
- Phase 13 certificates: `(user_id, status, issued_at)` for student portal listings, `(course_id, status)` for course credential reporting, `(status, issued_at)` for administrative filtering, and `issued_by_id` for staff action auditing. Public verification uses the unique index on `certificate_number`.

## 5. Connections: local vs. Neon

| Variable              | Used by                                          | Local (Docker)                               | Neon (staging/production)                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL`        | Running API (`pg` pool via `@prisma/adapter-pg`) | `postgresql://…@localhost:5432/asra_academy` | **Pooled** endpoint (`…-pooler…`) with `sslmode=require` |
| `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL` | Prisma CLI (`prisma.config.ts`): migrate, studio | same as `DATABASE_URL`                       | **Direct** endpoint with `sslmode=require`               |
| `DATABASE_POOL_MAX`   | API pool size per process (default 10)           | default                                      | keep small; the Neon pooler multiplexes                  |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL`   | Automated tests (optional)                       | defaults to `<DATABASE_URL db>_test`         | **never** Neon (refused by the test harness)             |

In Prisma 7 the schema's `datasource` block holds no URL:

- `prisma.config.ts` supplies the CLI URL (`DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`, falling back to `DATABASE_URL`);
- the runtime client receives `DATABASE_URL` through the driver adapter (`apps/api/src/database/prisma.ts`).
- the seed (`prisma db seed` → `prisma/seed.ts`) uses that same runtime client, so it connects through `DATABASE_URL`.

Migrations go over the direct connection because they take advisory locks, which PgBouncer transaction pooling does not support.

## 6. Day-to-day workflow (local)

All commands run from the repository root.

```bash
# 1. Start PostgreSQL + Redis and wait for "(healthy)"
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps

# 2. Check PostgreSQL readiness directly (optional)
docker exec asra-postgres pg_isready -U asra -d asra_academy

# 3. Generate the Prisma client and validate the schema
npm run db:generate
npm run db:validate

# 4. Apply all migrations (creates the database objects on a fresh volume)
npm run db:migrate

# 5. Seed reference data (roles + permissions) — safe to repeat
npm run db:seed

# 6. Inspect data
npm run db:studio            # http://localhost:5555
npm run check:services       # PostgreSQL + Redis connectivity
npm run db:migrate:status    # applied vs. pending migrations
```

### Changing the schema

1. Edit `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. Run `npm run db:migrate -- --name <short_snake_case_name>`. This creates `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`, applies it locally and regenerates the client.
   - To review or hand-edit the SQL first (e.g. to add a CHECK constraint or a data backfill), run `npm run db:migrate:create -- --name <name>`, edit the file, then run `npm run db:migrate`.
3. Run `npm test -w @asra/api`. The schema test fails if the migrations and `schema.prisma` disagree.
4. Commit the schema **and** the new migration folder together. Never edit a migration that has already been applied outside your machine; add a new migration instead.

### Command reference

| `npm run db:reset`          | `prisma migrate reset` + seed (guarded)      | ⚠ **Destroys all local data**; asks for confirmation           |

"Guarded" commands go through `apps/api/scripts/db-command.ts`. It refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production` or when the migration URL's host is not local (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `host.docker.internal`). A Neon URL is therefore always rejected.

## 7. Resetting the local database

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This **drops every table and all data** in the local database. It then re-applies all migrations and runs the seed. Prisma asks for confirmation first, and the guard refuses non-local hosts.

To wipe the Docker volume entirely (e.g. after changing `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`):

```bash
docker compose down -v      # deletes the asra_postgres_data volume
docker compose up -d
npm run db:migrate && npm run db:seed
```

Nothing resets the database automatically: not `npm run dev`, not API startup, and not CI.

## 8. Seed

`apps/api/prisma/seed.ts` calls `seedAccessControl()` (`apps/api/src/database/seed/`). The seed creates **only** RBAC reference data:

Permission keys are shared with the web app as `PERMISSIONS` in `@asra/types`. Permissions for later modules (payments, assessments, certificates, notifications and reports) will be added in their phases. Because the seed is additive, run `npm run db:seed` once on existing databases to grant `enrollments.manage` (Phase 07), the three faculty permissions (Phase 08) and the Phase 12 permissions `analytics.view`, `notifications.view` and `audit_logs.view` — the admin dashboard returns 403 until this is done. The `*_assigned` permissions always also require a `CourseInstructor` assignment (FACULTY-PORTAL.md §2).

Properties:

- **Idempotent.** Roles and permissions are upserted by `key`, and grants use `createMany({ skipDuplicates: true })`. Re-running changes nothing (this is covered by tests).
- **Additive.** The seed never removes grants, so permissions an administrator adds later survive a re-seed. Removing a permission from the definitions requires an explicit migration or admin action.
- **Atomic.** The seed runs in one interactive transaction (~18 sequential round trips: one upsert per permission and role, then one grant insert). Its limits are raised above Prisma's 5 s default (`SEED_TRANSACTION_OPTIONS`) because, run from a workstation against remote Neon, each round trip can take a few hundred milliseconds.
- **No accounts.** No administrator, test user, password or email is seeded. Staff accounts (including the first Super Admin) are created explicitly with `npm run auth:create-user -- --email … --name "…" --role SUPER_ADMIN` (password via hidden prompt or `NEW_USER_PASSWORD`) — see [AUTHENTICATION.md §7](./AUTHENTICATION.md#7-provisioning-staff-accounts).
- **No academic catalogue.** The final classes, streams, subjects and courses are pending client confirmation; administrators create them in the Phase 06 admin portal.

## 9. Neon (staging / production)

Neon credentials were **not available during Phase 02**. Connectivity to Neon has **not been tested**; all verification used local Docker PostgreSQL.

To verify a Neon branch:

1. In the Neon console, create (or select) a project in the region closest to India (W-02), plus a branch (e.g. `dev`).
2. Copy **both** connection strings, each with `sslmode=require`:
   - Pooled (host contains `-pooler`) → `DATABASE_URL`
   - Direct → `DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
3. Set them in the shell or the deployment platform's secret store, never in a committed file:

   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://…-pooler…/asra?sslmode=require'
   export DIRECT_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://…/asra?sslmode=require'
   ```

4. Apply migrations with the non-destructive command: `npm run db:migrate:deploy`.
5. Check status: `npm run db:migrate:status` (expect "Database schema is up to date").
6. Seed reference data: `npm run db:seed`.
7. Check connectivity: `npm run check:services`. Alternatively, start the API and call `GET /api/v1/health/ready` (expect `"database": "up"`).

Production rules:

- Migrations are applied **deliberately**, as a deployment step (`db:migrate:deploy`), never on API startup.
- `db:migrate`, `db:migrate:create` and `db:reset` cannot target Neon; the guard refuses them.
- Use a dedicated least-privilege runtime role for `DATABASE_URL` where possible (FR-SEC-006). The migration role needs DDL rights.
- Backups and point-in-time recovery are provided by Neon. Retention is pending (W-05).

## 10. Tests

`npm test -w @asra/api` uses Node's built-in test runner with `tsx`, so no extra dependencies are needed. It runs against a **separate local database**: `TEST_DATABASE_URL`, or by default `DATABASE_URL` with `_test` appended (`asra_academy_test`). The harness refuses any non-local host and any database whose name does not end in `_test`.

Before the tests run, `npm run test:db:prepare -w @asra/api` creates the test database if needed and applies migrations with `migrate deploy`.

`resetAuthState()` (tests/support/auth.ts) rebuilds role grants from the seed definitions before each test, so a permission granted at runtime by one test cannot leak into another suite (the seed itself stays additive).
